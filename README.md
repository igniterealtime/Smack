About
-----

[Smack] is an open source, highly modular, easy to use, XMPP client library written in Java for Java SE compatible JVMs and Android.

A pure Java library, it can be embedded into your applications to create anything from a full XMPP instant messaging client to simple XMPP integrations such as sending notification messages and presence-enabling devices.
Smack and XMPP allows you to easily exchange data, in various ways e.g. fire-and-forget, publish-subscribe, between human and non-human endpoints (M2M, IoT, …).

More information are provided by the [Overview](documentation/overview.md).

Getting started
---------------

Start with having a look at the **[Documentation]** and the **[Javadoc]**.

Instructions how to use Smack in your Java or Android project are provided in the [Smack 4.2 Readme and Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/wiki/Smack-4.2-Readme-and-Upgrade-Guide).

Professional Services
---------------------

Smack is a collaborative effort of many open source, professionally and spare-time, paid and unpaid, contributors.
While we try to provide the best possible XMPP library for Android and Java SE compatible execution environments by following state of the art software engineering practices, the API may not always perfectly fit your requirements.
We welcome contributions and encourage discussion about how Smack can be further improved.
We also provide **paid services** ranging from **XMPP/Smack related consulting** to **designing and developing features** in order to accommodate your needs.
Please contact [Florian Schmaus](mailto:flo@geekplace.eu) for futher information.
