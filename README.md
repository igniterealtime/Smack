About
-----

[Smack] is an open-source, highly modular, easy to use, XMPP client library written in Java for Java SE compatible JVMs and Android.

Being a pure Java library, it can be embedded into your applications to create anything from a full XMPP instant messaging client to simple XMPP integrations such as sending notification messages and presence-enabling devices.
Smack and XMPP allow you to easily exchange data in various ways e.g., fire-and-forget, publish-subscribe, between human and non-human endpoints (M2M, IoT, …).

More information is provided by the [Overview](documentation/overview.md).

Getting started
---------------

Start with having a look at the **[Documentation]** and the **[Javadoc]**.

Instructions on how to use Smack in your Java or Android project are provided in the [Smack Readme and Upgrade Guide](https://igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/readme).

Professional Services
---------------------

Smack is a collaborative effort of many people.
Some are paid, e.g., by their employer or a third party, for their contributions.
But many contribute in their spare time for free.
While we try to provide the best possible XMPP library for Android and Java SE-compatible execution environments by following state-of-the-art software engineering practices, the API may not always perfectly fit your requirements.
Hence welcome contributions and encourage discussion about how Smack can be further improved.
We also provide **paid services** ranging from **XMPP/Smack related consulting** to **designing and developing features** to accommodate your needs.
Please contact [Florian Schmaus](mailto:flo@geekplace.eu) for further information.
