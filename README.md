About

[Smack] is an Open Source [XMPP (Jabber)] client library for instant
messaging and presence. A pure Java library, it can be embedded into
your applications to create anything from a full XMPP client to simple
XMPP integrations such as sending notification messages and
presence-enabling devices.
