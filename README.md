About
-----

[Smack] is an open source, cross-platform, easy to use, Java XMPP client library.

A pure Java library, it can be embedded into your applications to create anything from a full XMPP client to simple XMPP integrations such as sending notification messages and presence-enabling devices.
Smack and XMPP allows you to easily exchange data, in various ways e.g. fire-and-forget, publish-subscribe, between human and non-human endpoints.

Confused? Have a look at the [Overview](documentation/overview.md).

[Smack] - an [Ignite Realtime] community project.
