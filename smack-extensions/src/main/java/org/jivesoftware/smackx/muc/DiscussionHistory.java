 * The DiscussionHistory class controls the number of characters or messages to receive

 * <ul>
 *  <li>maxchars -> total number of characters to receive in the history.
 *  <li>maxstanzas -> total number of messages to receive in the history.
 *  <li>seconds -> only the messages received in the last "X" seconds will be included in the

 *  <li>since -> only the messages received since the datetime specified will be included in 
 * the history.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note: Setting maxchars to 0 indicates that the user requests to receive no history.
