/**
 * This class represents an item that has been, or will be published to a
 * pubsub node.  An <tt>Item</tt> has several properties that are dependent
 * on the configuration of the node to which it has been or will be published.
 * 
 * <h1>An Item received from a node (via {@link LeafNode#getItems()} or {@link LeafNode#addItemEventListener(org.jivesoftware.smackx.pubsub.listener.ItemEventListener)}</b>
 * <li>Will always have an id (either user or server generated) unless node configuration has both
 * {@link ConfigureForm#isPersistItems()} and {@link ConfigureForm#isDeliverPayloads()}set to false.
 * <li>Will have a payload if the node configuration has {@link ConfigureForm#isDeliverPayloads()} set 
 * to true, otherwise it will be null.
 * 
 * <h1>An Item created to send to a node (via {@link LeafNode#send()} or {@link LeafNode#publish()}</b>
 * <li>The id is optional, since the server will generate one if necessary, but should be used if it is 
 * meaningful in the context of the node.  This value must be unique within the node that it is sent to, since
 * resending an item with the same id will overwrite the one that already exists if the items are persisted.
 * <li>Will require payload if the node configuration has {@link ConfigureForm#isDeliverPayloads()} set
 * to true. 
 * 
 * <p>To customise the payload object being returned from the {@link PayloadItem#getPayload()} method, you can
 * add a custom parser as explained in {@link ItemProvider}.
