/**
 * This interface defines {@link ExtensionElement} implementations that contain other
 * extensions.  This effectively extends the idea of an extension within one of the 
 * top level {@link Stanza} types to consider any embedded element to be an extension
 * of its parent.  This more easily enables the usage of some of Smacks parsing
 * utilities such as {@link PacketParserUtils#parseExtensionElement(String, String, org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParser)} to be used
 * to parse any element of the XML being parsed.
 * 
 * <p>Top level extensions have only one element, but they can have multiple children, or
 * their children can have multiple children.  This interface is a way of allowing extensions 
 * to be embedded within one another as a partial or complete one to one mapping of extension 
 * to element.
