/**
 * An ad-hoc command is responsible for executing the provided service and
 * storing the result of the execution. Each new request will create a new
 * instance of the command, allowing information related to executions to be
 * stored in it. For example suppose that a command that retrieves the list of
 * users on a server is implemented. When the command is executed it gets that
 * list and the result is stored as a form in the command instance, i.e. the
 * <code>getForm</code> method retrieves a form with all the users.
 * <p>
 * Each command has a <tt>node</tt> that should be unique within a given JID.
 * <p>
 * Commands may have zero or more stages. Each stage is usually used for
 * gathering information required for the command execution. Users are able to
 * move forward or backward across the different stages. Commands may not be
 * cancelled while they are being executed. However, users may request the
 * "cancel" action when submitting a stage response indicating that the command
 * execution should be aborted. Thus, releasing any collected information.
 * Commands that require user interaction (i.e. have more than one stage) will
 * have to provide the data forms the user must complete in each stage and the
 * allowed actions the user might perform during each stage (e.g. go to the
 * previous stage or go to the next stage).
 * <p>
 * All the actions may throw an XMPPException if there is a problem executing
 * them. The <code>XMPPError</code> of that exception may have some specific
 * information about the problem. The possible extensions are:
 * 
 * <li><i>malformed-action</i>. Extension of a <i>bad-request</i> error.</li>
 * <li><i>bad-action</i>. Extension of a <i>bad-request</i> error.</li>
 * <li><i>bad-locale</i>. Extension of a <i>bad-request</i> error.</li>
 * <li><i>bad-payload</i>. Extension of a <i>bad-request</i> error.</li>
 * <li><i>bad-sessionid</i>. Extension of a <i>bad-request</i> error.</li>
 * <li><i>session-expired</i>. Extension of a <i>not-allowed</i> error.</li>
 * <p>
 * See the <code>SpecificErrorCondition</code> class for detailed description
 * of each one.
 * <p>
 * Use the <code>getSpecificErrorConditionFrom</code> to obtain the specific
 * information from an <code>XMPPError</code>.
