/**
 * Very simple debugger that prints to the console (stdout) the sent and received stanzas. Use
 * this debugger with caution since printing to the console is an expensive operation that may
 * even block the thread since only one thread may print at a time.<p>
 * <p/>
 * It is possible to not only print the raw sent and received stanzas but also the interpreted
 * packets by Smack. By default interpreted packets won't be printed. To enable this feature
 * just change the <tt>printInterpreted</tt> static variable to <tt>true</tt>.
