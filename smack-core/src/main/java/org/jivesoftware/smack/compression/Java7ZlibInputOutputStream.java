/**
 * This class provides XMPP "zlib" compression with the help of the Deflater class of the Java API.
 * Note that the method needed for compression with synchronous flush support is available since
 * Java7, so it will only work with Java7 or higher (hence it's name). On Android, the required
 * <code>deflate()</code> method is available on API 19 or higher.
