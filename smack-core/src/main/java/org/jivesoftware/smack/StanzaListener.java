 * opposite approach to the functionality provided by a {@link PacketCollector}
 * which lets you block while waiting for results.
 * <p>
 * Additionally you are able to intercept Packets that are going to be send and
 * make modifications to them. You can register a PacketListener as interceptor
 * by using {@link XMPPConnection#addPacketInterceptor(StanzaListener,
