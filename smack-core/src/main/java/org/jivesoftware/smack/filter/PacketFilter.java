package org.jivesoftware.smack.filter;

/**
 * Defines a way to filter packets for particular attributes. Packet filters are used when
 * constructing packet listeners or collectors -- the filter defines what packets match the criteria
 * of the collector or listener for further packet processing.
 * <p>
 * Several simple filters are pre-defined. These filters can be logically combined for more complex
 * packet filtering by using the {@link org.jivesoftware.smack.filter.AndFilter AndFilter} and
 * {@link org.jivesoftware.smack.filter.OrFilter OrFilter} filters. It's also possible to define
 * your own filters by implementing this interface. The code example below creates a trivial filter
 * for packets with a specific ID (real code should use {@link StanzaIdFilter} instead).
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Use an anonymous inner class to define a packet filter that returns
 * // all packets that have a packet ID of &quot;RS145&quot;.
 * PacketFilter myFilter = new PacketFilter() {
 *     public boolean accept(Packet packet) {
 *         return &quot;RS145&quot;.equals(packet.getStanzaId());
 *     }
 * };
 * // Create a new packet collector using the filter we created.
 * PacketCollector myCollector = packetReader.createPacketCollector(myFilter);
 * </pre>
