/**
 * Defines a way to filter stanzas for particular attributes. Stanza filters are used when
 * constructing stanza listeners or collectors -- the filter defines what stanzas match the criteria
 * of the collector or listener for further stanza processing.
 * <p>
 * Several simple filters are pre-defined. These filters can be logically combined for more complex
 * stanza filtering by using the {@link org.jivesoftware.smack.filter.AndFilter AndFilter} and
 * {@link org.jivesoftware.smack.filter.OrFilter OrFilter} filters. It's also possible to define
 * your own filters by implementing this interface. The code example below creates a trivial filter
 * for stanzas with a specific ID (real code should use {@link StanzaIdFilter} instead).
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Use an anonymous inner class to define a stanza filter that returns
 * // all stanzas that have a stanza ID of &quot;RS145&quot;.
 * StanzaFilter myFilter = new StanzaFilter() {
 *     public boolean accept(Stanza stanza) {
 *         return &quot;RS145&quot;.equals(stanza.getStanzaId());
 *     }
 * };
 * // Create a new stanza collector using the filter we created.
 * PacketCollector myCollector = connection.createPacketCollector(myFilter);
 * </pre>
