/**
 * The XMPPConnection interface provides an interface for connections to an XMPP server and
 * implements shared methods which are used by the different types of connections (e.g.
 * <code>XMPPTCPConnection</code> or <code>XMPPBOSHConnection</code>). To create a connection to an XMPP server
 * a simple usage of this API might look like the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create a connection to the igniterealtime.org XMPP server.
 * XMPPTCPConnection con = new XMPPTCPConnection("igniterealtime.org");
 * // Connect to the server
 * con.connect();
 * // Most servers require you to login before performing other tasks.
 * con.login("jsmith", "mypass");
 * // Start a new conversation with John Doe and send him a message.
 * ChatManager chatManager = ChatManager.getInstanceFor(con);
 * chatManager.addIncomingListener(new IncomingChatMessageListener() {
 *     public void newIncomingMessage(EntityBareJid from, Message message, Chat chat) {
 *         // Print out any messages we get back to standard out.
 *         System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
 *     }
 * });
 * Chat chat = chatManager.chatWith("jdoe@igniterealtime.org");
 * chat.send("Howdy!");
 * // Disconnect from the server
 * con.disconnect();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that the XMPPConnection interface does intentionally not declare any methods that manipulate
 * the connection state, e.g. <code>connect()</code>, <code>disconnect()</code>. You should use the
 * most specific connection type, e.g. <code>XMPPTCPConnection</code> as declared type and use the
 * XMPPConnection interface when you don't need to manipulate the connection state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * XMPPConnections can be reused between connections. This means that an Connection may be connected,
 * disconnected and then connected again. Listeners of the XMPPConnection will be retained across
 * connections.
 * </p>
