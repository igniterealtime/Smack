    it wants to establish a connection to an application server. The client
    includes in the request packet the IP address and the port number of the
    destination host, and userid, in the following format.

    The SOCKS server checks to see whether such a request should be granted
    based on any combination of source IP address, destination IP address,
    destination port number, the userid, and information it may obtain by
    consulting IDENT, cf. RFC 1413.  If the request is granted, the SOCKS
    server makes a connection to the specified port of the destination host.
    A reply packet is sent to the client when this connection is established,
    or when the request is rejected or the operation fails.

    code with one of the following values:

    90: request granted
    91: request rejected or failed
    92: request rejected because SOCKS server cannot connect to
    identd on the client
    93: request rejected because the client program and identd
    report different user-ids
