/**
 * Helper class to perform an operation asynchronous but keeping the order in respect to a given key.
 * <p>
 * A typical use pattern for this helper class consists of callbacks for an abstract entity where the order of callbacks
 * matters, which eventually call user code in form of listeners. Since the order the callbacks matters, you need to use
 * synchronous connection listeners. But if those listeners would invoke the user provided listeners, and if those user
 * provided listeners would take a long time to complete, or even worse, block, then Smack's total progress is stalled,
 * since synchronous connection listeners are invoked from the main event loop.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is common for those situations that the order of callbacks is not globally important, but only important in
 * respect to an particular entity. Take chat state notifications (CSN) for example: Assume there are two contacts which
 * send you CSNs. If a contact sends you first 'active' and then 'inactive, it is crucial that first the listener is
 * called with 'active' and afterwards with 'inactive'. But if there is another contact is sending 'composing' followed
 * by 'paused', then it is also important that the listeners are invoked in the correct order, but the order in which
 * the listeners for those two contacts are invoked does not matter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Using this helper class, one would call {@link #performAsyncButOrdered(Object, Runnable)} which the remote contacts
 * JID as first argument and a {@link Runnable} invoking the user listeners as second. This class guarantees that
 * runnables of subsequent invocations are always executed after the runnables of previous invocations using the same
 * key.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <K> the type of the key
 * @since 4.3
