 * Interface to represent XMPP extension elements. Unlike {@link XmlElement}, every non-abstract class that implements
 * {@link ExtensionElement} must have a static final QNAME member of the type {@link javax.xml.namespace.QName}. This
 * allows type-safe functions like {@link StanzaView#getExtension(Class)}. Hence this is a marker interface.
 * <p>
 * Use this class when implementing new extension elements when possible. This means that every instance of your
 * implemented class must represent an XML element of the same qualified name.
