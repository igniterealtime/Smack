/**
 * Interface to represent extension elements.
 * <p>
 * An extension element is an XML subdocument
 * with a root element name and namespace. Extension elements are used to provide
 * extended functionality beyond what is in the base XMPP specification. Examples of
 * extensions elements include message events, message properties, and extra presence data.
 * IQ stanzas have limited support for extension elements.
 * <p>
 * This class is used primarily for extended content in XMPP Stanzas, to act as so called "extension elements". For more
 * information see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-8.4">RFC 6120 ยง 8.4 Extended Content</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see DefaultExtensionElement
 * @see org.jivesoftware.smack.provider.ExtensionElementProvider
 * @author Matt Tucker
 * @deprecated use {@link ExtensionElement} instead.
