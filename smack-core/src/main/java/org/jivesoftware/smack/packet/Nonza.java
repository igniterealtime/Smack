 * A Nonza, i.e everything that is <b>not a stanza</b> as defined
 * RFC 6120 8. Stanzas are {@link Message}, {@link Presence} and {@link IQ}.
 * Everything else should sublcass this class instead of {@link Stanza}.
 * <p>
 * It is important to cleanly distinguish between stanzas and non-stanzas. For
 * example plain stream elements don't count into the stanza count of XEP-198
 * Stream Management.
