 * Very simple debugger that prints to the android log the sent and received stanzas.
 * <p>
 * Only use this debugger if really required, Android has a good java.util.logging
 * implementation, therefore {@link org.jivesoftware.smack.debugger.JulDebugger} is preferred.
 * </p>
 * It is possible to not only print the raw sent and received stanzas but also the interpreted
 * packets by Smack. By default interpreted packets won't be printed. To enable this feature
 * just change the <code>printInterpreted</code> static variable to <code>true</code>.
