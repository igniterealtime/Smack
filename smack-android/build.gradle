Smack for Android.

smack-extensions and smack-experimental."""

	// not need it. Can't hurt to have it in the programm path with
	// the correct MiniDNS version as it won't hurt even if the
	// Android version is smaller then 21. Note that we deliberatly do
	// not add this to smack-minidns, as this dependency may also be
	// used in non-Android projects.
