     * when a user account is online with multiple resources, the UI should account
     * for that. For example, say a user is online with their desktop computer and
     * mobile phone. If the user logs out of the IM client on their mobile phone, the
     * user should not be shown in the roster (contact list) as offline since they're
     * still available as another resource.<p>
     *
     * To get the current "best presence" for a user after the presence update, query the roster:
     * <pre>
     *    String user = presence.getFrom();
     *    Presence bestPresence = roster.getPresence(user);
     * </pre>
     *
     * That will return the presence value for the user with the highest priority and
     * availability.
     *
     * Note that this listener is triggered for presence (mode) changes only
     * (e.g presence of types available and unavailable. Subscription-related
     * presence packets will not cause this method to be called.
     *
     * @param presence the presence that changed.
     * @see Roster#getPresence(Jid)
