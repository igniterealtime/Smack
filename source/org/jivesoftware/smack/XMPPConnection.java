 * XMPPConnection con = new XMPPConnection("igniterealtime.org");
 * // Connect to the server
 * con.connect();
 * // Most servers require you to login before performing other tasks.
 * con.login("jsmith", "mypass");
 * // Start a new conversation with John Doe and send him a message.
 * Chat chat = connection.getChatManager().createChat("jdoe@igniterealtime.org"</font>, new MessageListener() {
 * <p/>
 *     public void processMessage(Chat chat, Message message) {
 *         // Print out any messages we get back to standard out.
 *         System.out.println(<font color="green">"Received message: "</font> + message);
 *     }
 * });
 * chat.sendMessage(<font color="green">"Howdy!"</font>);
 * // Disconnect from the server
 * con.disconnect();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * XMPPConnections can be reused between connections. This means that an XMPPConnection
 * may be connected, disconnected and then connected again. Listeners of the XMPPConnection
 * will be retained accross connections.<p>
 * <p/>
 * If a connected XMPPConnection gets disconnected abruptly then it will try to reconnect
 * again. To stop the reconnection process, use {@link #disconnect()}. Once stopped
 * you can use {@link #connect()} to manually connect to the server.
